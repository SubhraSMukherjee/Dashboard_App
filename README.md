## A Platform independent Python Based Dashboard
---
This repository (script really) implements a free opensource Flask based Dashboard in Python, based on the [Plotly Graphing Library](https://plotly.com/python/)

### Motivation
---
Commercially available Dashboarding Tools like Google LookerStudio, Google Looker, Tableau, Power BI cannot be used for Free for personal visualization projects. Also, they only offer a limited range of visualizations.
Opensource dashboards are much more flexible, provide many more visualization alternatives and is Free!!
